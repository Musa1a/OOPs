        "**Answer:** Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass has the same name, parameters, and functionality as the method in the parent class, but it can provide a different or more specific behavior.\n",

        "**Answer:** Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it plays a critical role in making programs more flexible, extensible, and easier to maintain. The term polymorphism means \"many shapes\" and refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different types to be handled using a common interface, typically by inheriting from the same superclass or implementing the same interface.\n",

        "**Question-16:  What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages that make it an attractive paradigm for developing software, particularly for large, complex, or long-term projects. Here are some of the key advantages of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Modularity**\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP encourages modular programming, where the software is divided into small, self-contained objects that are easier to manage and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each object typically corresponds to a real-world entity, and its functionality is encapsulated in its class. This makes it easier to update, maintain, and scale the software by focusing on individual objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** In a game development scenario, you might have classes like Player, Enemy, Weapon, and PowerUp. These classes are modular and can be worked on independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Reusability**\n",
        "\n",
        "Code reusability is one of the biggest benefits of OOP. Once a class is written and tested, it can be reused in other parts of the program or even in different projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows you to create new classes by building upon existing ones, without having to rewrite the same code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** You can create a base Shape class, and then inherit it in Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle classes, reusing the common features.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Maintainability**\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP's use of modular design and encapsulation makes software easier to maintain and update.\n",
        "\n",
        "When changes are required, they are often limited to one part of the system, reducing the risk of affecting unrelated components.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** If a new feature is added to the Player class in a game, it won't affect other components like the Enemy class, as long as their interactions are well-defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Extensibility**\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP allows for the easy extension of systems. New functionality can be added with minimal changes to existing code, making the system highly extensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can create subclasses that extend the functionality of parent classes through inheritance, and polymorphism allows for flexible behavior in different contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** You can add new types of Shape (e.g., Hexagon) without changing the existing Circle or Rectangle classes, and without affecting any code that uses those classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Encapsulation**\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation refers to the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which helps prevent accidental modification and encourages better data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** You might use a BankAccount class with a private attribute for balance, and provide getter and setter methods to control how the balance is modified."

        "\n",

        "**9. Better Data Security**\n",
        "\n",
        "With OOP's encapsulation, you can control what data is accessible from outside the class, making it possible to restrict access to sensitive information and protect data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is especially important in scenarios where security and integrity of data are critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** In a banking system, account balances might be hidden from direct access and modified only through controlled methods like deposit and withdraw.\n",

        "OOP provides a structured approach to software development that makes code more modular, reusable, and maintainable. By encouraging practices like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, it helps create flexible, extensible, and scalable software systems. These advantages make OOP a powerful paradigm for developing complex applications."
